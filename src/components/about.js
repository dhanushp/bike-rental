                <p>We are a bunch of millennials focused on building India’s largest mobility solutions provider. Our focus has led us to build a platform providing rentals spanning across 14 states, 43 cities and 3 international cities.
Transportation and mobility solutions is one of the least understood and most unorganized markets. We see this as an unexplored opportunity to build a system that can be trusted by everyone beyond barriers.
We have no limitations when it comes to two wheelers and enjoy serving everything from a scooter to a superbike available on both website and mobile application.
We are obsessed with the concept of <span>‘Why buy when you can rent’.</span></p>
